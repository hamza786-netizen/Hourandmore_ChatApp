# üîß Notification Debug Guide

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. **Check Permissions First**

- Tap "Send FCM Notification" (purple button)
- Check logs for detailed debugging info

   - Check Firebase console for delivery status

2. **If nothing works:**
   - Check device notification settings
   - Try on different device
   - Check app permissions thoroughly

3. **If everything works:**
   - Integrate into chat functionality
   - Add notification sounds and vibrations
   - Test with real users

## Debug Commands

```bash
# Check app compilation
flutter analyze

# Run app in debug mode
flutter run --debug

# Check device logs (Android)
adb logcat | grep -i notification

# Check device logs (iOS)
# Use Xcode Console or device logs
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the logs** in the FCM Test Screen
2. **Try on a different device** to isolate the issue
3. **Check Firebase Console** for delivery reports
4. **Verify API endpoint** is working with curl/Postman
5. **Test with a simple notification** first

Remember: Local notifications must work before FCM notifications will work!
